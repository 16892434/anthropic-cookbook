        "1. Follow a comprehensive tutorial on setting up your development environment, from installing necessary libraries to configuring a MongoDB database.\n",

        "- Checks if the response status code is 200 (OK), indicating the request was successful.\n",

        "- Appends the DataFrame to the list all_dataframes.\n",
        "4. Combine DataFrames: After downloading and reading all Parquet files into DataFrames, there’s a check to ensure that `all_dataframes` is not empty. If there are DataFrames to work with, then all DataFrames are concatenated into a single DataFrame using pd.concat, with ignore_index=True to reindex the new combined DataFrame. This combined DataFrame is the overall process output in the `download_and_combine_parquet_files` function."
