# Claude Skills

Welcome to the Skills section of the Anthropic Cookbook! This directory contains a collection of guides that showcase specific skills and capabilities where Claude excels. Each guide provides an in-depth exploration of a particular skill, discussing potential use cases, prompt engineering techniques to optimize results, and approaches for evaluating Claude's performance.

## Guides

- **[Classification with Claude](./classification/guide.ipynb)**: Discover how Claude can revolutionize classification tasks, especially in scenarios with complex business rules and limited training data. This guide walks you through data preparation, prompt engineering with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), testing, and evaluation.

- **[Retrieval Augmented Generation with Claude](./retrieval_augmented_generation/guide.ipynb)**: Learn how to enhance Claude's capabilities with domain-specific knowledge using RAG. This guide demonstrates how to build a RAG system from scratch, optimize its performance, and create an evaluation suite. You'll learn how techniques like summary indexing and re-ranking can significantly improve precision, recall, and overall accuracy in question-answering tasks.

- **[Citations with Claude](./citations/guide.ipynb)**: Learn how to leverage Claude for accurate and verifiable information retrieval. This guide demonstrates how to implement citations in two key scenarios: Q&A over a help center and extracting quotes from large documents. You'll explore prompt engineering techniques, post-processing methods, and strategies for creating user-friendly, interactive experiences with cited information.


## Getting Started

To get started with the Skills guides, simply navigate to the desired guide's directory and follow the instructions provided in the `guide.ipynb` file. Each guide is self-contained and includes all the necessary code, data, and evaluation scripts to reproduce the examples and experiments.
