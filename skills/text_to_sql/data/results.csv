To answer this query, we need to:
1. Join the employees and departments tables since the department information is in a separate table.
2. Filter for employees in the Engineering department.
3. Select only the names of these employees.

The steps to create the SQL query:
1. Start with SELECT to choose the employee names.
2. FROM the employees table.
3. JOIN with the departments table to get department information.
4. Use WHERE to filter for the Engineering department.
5. The join condition will be on the department_id in employees and id in departments.

To solve this query, I will need to join the `employees` and `departments` tables on the `department_id` and `id` columns, and then select the `name` column from the `employees` table where the `name` column in the `departments` table is 'Engineering'.

The key steps are:
1. Join the `employees` and `departments` tables on the `department_id` and `id` columns.
2. Filter the results to only include rows where the `name` column in the `departments` table is 'Engineering'.
3. Select the `name` column from the `employees` table.

To solve this query, I will need to join the `employees` and `departments` tables on the `department_id` column in the `employees` table and the `id` column in the `departments` table. This will allow me to access the department name and count the number of employees in the ""Engineering"" department.

The key steps are:
1. Join the `employees` and `departments` tables on the appropriate columns.
2. Filter the results to only include rows where the department name is ""Engineering"".
3. Count the number of rows in the filtered result to get the total number of employees in the Engineering department.

- The relevant tables are 'employees' and 'departments'.
- The relevant columns are 'name', 'age', 'salary', and 'department_id' from the 'employees' table, and 'name' from the 'departments' table.
2. Filter the 'employees' table to only include employees from the 'Engineering' department.
